This circuit uses a 14V power supply to charge a 12V 7Ah lead-acid battery and also power a router and fiber modem. When AC falls away the MT3608 boost converters provides power from the battery.

Note: MT3608 is extremely sensitive to overcurrent and pops easily.

Note also: the better way is not to permanently use the boot converters, but rather use the normal power supplies of the router and modem when AC is on, and then switch to the battery and boost converters when AC falls away. 

A fan is required to cool the boost converters on a continuing basis.
